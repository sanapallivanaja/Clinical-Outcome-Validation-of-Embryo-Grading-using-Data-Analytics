# Clinical-Outcome-Validation-of-Embryo-Grading-using-Data-Analytics

My project is titled “Clinical Outcome Validation of Embryo Grading Using Data Analytics”. This project was done for a leading IVF clinic in India. The main problem addressed in this project is that embryo grading varies across embryologists, which leads to inconsistent embryo selection and unpredictable clinical outcomes.

The objective of my project was to analyze historical clinical data to validate whether the existing embryo grading system truly correlates with successful pregnancy outcomes. I worked with key parameters such as patient age, fragmentation percentage, blastocyst expansion, and morphology grade (1AA, 2AB, 3BB, etc.).

I performed data preprocessing steps like cleaning missing values, handling outliers, feature scaling, and creating meaningful age bands for better analysis. Then, I created visualizations in Power BI to study relationships between embryo quality, patient age, and clinical success rates.

Through my analysis, I identified which grading parameters had the strongest impact on pregnancy outcomes and provided data-driven insights that can help embryologists make more consistent and reliable embryo selection decisions in the future.

This project demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, Power BI visualization, and applying analytics to a real-world healthcare problem.
